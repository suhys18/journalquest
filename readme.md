## **Introduction**

Welcome to **My Dopamine-Growth Journal RPG**\! This is a unique, gamified journaling web application born from **my personal insight** into how unproductive "dopamine hits" can hinder growth. My goal was to create a tool that not only tracks daily activities but also actively encourages more mindful, productive choices by turning self-improvement into an engaging game.

With the assistance of an AI, this concept has been transformed into a functional application. It assigns dynamic "Growth Scores" to tasks based on factors like time spent, physical and brain activity, and the nature of the dopamine reward. As you use it, you'll unlock achievements, level up, and build streaks, providing tangible motivation to pursue your long-term goals.

## **Features**

This application offers a comprehensive suite of features to support your growth journey:

* **Detailed Task Logging:**  
  * Record each task with a description.  
  * Rate **Dopamine Level** (1-5, with vivid descriptions from "Barely there, like a sip of water" to "Explosive joy, like hitting a jackpot\!").  
  * Indicate **Impact on Growth** (Good \+ or Bad \-).  
  * Log **Time Taken** (in minutes).  
  * Assess **Physical Activity Level** (1-5, with clear descriptions from "Minimal movement, e.g., typing" to "Intense activity, e.g., 45min football, heavy workout").  
  * Assess **Brain Activity Level** (1-5, with clear descriptions from "Passive consumption, e.g., comprehending a comment" to "Intense focus, e.g., 3hrs hardcore problem solving, coding, deep work").  
* **Automated Growth Scoring:** Each task automatically calculates a Growth Score based on configurable weights, providing immediate feedback.  
* **Daily Mood Tracking:** Record your emotional state for each day, helping you identify patterns between mood and productivity.  
* **Daily Goals/Quests:** Set specific daily goals and mark them as complete to earn bonus Growth Score points, encouraging proactive planning.  
* **Gamified Progression:**  
  * **Leveling System:** Gain levels as your Total Growth Score accumulates, with a visual progress bar indicating your journey to the next level.  
  * **Achievements/Badges:** Unlock virtual badges for reaching milestones (e.g., cumulative score, streaks, total activity, days logged).  
  * **Daily Streaks:** Track consecutive days of positive overall growth scores, motivating consistency.  
  * **Emoji Visuals:** Instant visual feedback for dopamine levels, task impact, and overall scores using expressive emojis.  
* **Comprehensive Journal View:** Browse all your logged tasks and daily summaries, filterable by date.  
* **In-depth Growth Insights:**  
  * **Overall Trends:** See your average daily score, average tasks logged, and most common positive mood.  
  * **Period Summaries:** Generate weekly and monthly summaries of your growth.  
  * **Top & Bottom Tasks:** Identify which tasks consistently yield the highest or lowest growth scores, helping you prioritize or re-evaluate activities.  
  * **Activity Distribution:** Visualize the percentage breakdown of your physical and brain activity levels.  
  * **Mood Distribution:** See the percentage breakdown of your daily moods.  
* **Robust Data Management:**  
  * **Export Data:** Download your entire journal data as a JSON file for backup or transfer.  
  * **Import Data:** Upload a previously exported JSON file to restore your journal.  
  * **Clear All Data:** Option to wipe all local journal data (with a custom confirmation modal for safety\!).  
* **Customizable Scoring Weights:** Adjust the importance of different factors (time, physical activity, brain activity, dopamine penalty, goal bonus) directly within the application's settings, allowing you to tailor the scoring to your personal values.  
* **Integrated Vercel Analytics:** When deployed on Vercel, the site is configured to automatically track web analytics, providing you with insights into visitor traffic.

## **How It Works**

The Dopamine-Growth Journal RPG is a client-side web application, meaning it runs entirely in your web browser. It's built using:

* **HTML5:** Provides the structure and content of the web page.  
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling, ensuring a clean and modern user interface that looks great on any device.  
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all the interactive logic, including:  
  * Complex task calculation and scoring algorithms.  
  * Dynamic gamification mechanics (levels, achievements, streaks).  
  * Real-time UI updates based on your inputs.  
  * **localStorage:** All your journal data (entries, scores, game state, settings) is securely stored directly within your web browser's localStorage. This ensures your progress is saved even if you close the browser tab or window, and it will be there when you revisit the deployed URL.

## **Data Persistence & Management**

Your journal data is stored locally in your web browser's localStorage. This offers privacy and convenience, but it's important to understand its implications:

* **Automatic Saving:** Data is automatically saved whenever you add an entry, update daily info, or change settings.  
* **Local Storage:** Your data is tied to the specific browser you are using on that specific computer. It is *not* stored on any external server.  
* **Backup & Restore:**  
  * Use the **"Export Data"** button in the **Settings** tab to download a JSON file backup of your entire journal. This is crucial for safeguarding your progress.  
  * Use the **"Import Data"** option to upload a previously exported JSON file to restore your journal state. This is how you can transfer your journal to another browser or computer.  
* **Clear All Data:** The **"Clear All Journal Data"** button in the Settings tab will permanently delete all your entries and game progress from your browser. A custom confirmation modal is in place to prevent accidental deletion.

## **Customization**

You have direct control over key aspects of your gamified journey:

* **Scoring Weights:** In the **Settings** tab, you can dynamically adjust the numerical values for Time Taken, Physical Activity, Brain Activity, Dopamine Penalty, and Goal Completion Bonus. These weights directly influence how your Growth Score is calculated, allowing you to tailor the system to what truly matters for *your* growth.  
* **Levels & Achievements:**  
  * To modify the LEVEL\_THRESHOLDS (the score required for each level) or ACHIEVEMENTS (milestones and their rewards), you will need to edit the index.html file directly.  
  * Open index.html in a text editor.  
  * Scroll down to the \<script\> section.  
  * Locate the LEVEL\_THRESHOLDS and ACHIEVEMENTS JavaScript constants and modify their values. Save the file and trigger a new Vercel deployment to see your personalized progression.

## **Future Enhancements (Ideas)**

This project is a fantastic foundation, and there are many exciting ways it could be expanded:

* **Visual Data Trends:** Integrate a charting library (like Chart.js) to visualize your daily/weekly growth scores, mood trends, or activity levels over time.  
* **Customizable Achievements:** Allow users to define their own custom achievements directly within the UI.  
* **Task Tagging & Filtering:** Implement a system to tag tasks (e.g., \#work, \#hobby, \#learning) for more granular analysis and filtering.  
* **Reminders/Notifications:** Add local browser notifications for daily journaling prompts or goal reminders.  
* **Advanced Gamification:** Explore features like daily challenges, "boss battles" against specific unproductive habits, or a virtual currency for "buying" rewards.  
* **Cloud Synchronization:** For cross-device access, integrate with a simple backend service (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) to sync data.  
* **AI-Powered Reflections:** (Requires a backend with LLM access) Develop a feature where AI can analyze your journal entries and provide personalized insights, patterns, or actionable suggestions.

## **Contributing**

This project is a testament to how personal ideas can be rapidly prototyped with AI. While direct contributions to this specific AI-generated codebase aren't typically sought, you are highly encouraged to:

* **Fork this repository** (if you host it on GitHub) and experiment with your own modifications and new features.  
* **Share your ideas** for further enhancements or new gamification concepts.  
* **Provide feedback** on your experience using the journal.
